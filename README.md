## Telegram group

You might want to join this [telegram channel](https://t.me/joinchat/D_snZRsPkt8ttomJrINmqA) through which we will learn about the really basic Distributed Systems Theory and through which you can monitor the progress on Connectome 1.0 which is set to be released on 1.1.2021.

## 10 week build-up theory course

[Connectome weekly articles](https://david.zetaseek.com/blog)

## The Purpose of this LIB

This small and lean JavaScript library enables:

**Encrypted dynamic connections between each two endpoints.**

When v1.0 is released it will include state management (syncing and updating) over these connections.

It works transparently between:

- two node.js processes
- between in-browser JavaScript and a node.js process

## Current features (alpha)

- send and receive json messages
- RPC calls on javascript objects
- send and receive files

All messages and file transfers are encrypted.

## How to try if you are a JS developer

Get the library on your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/uniqpath/connectome.git
cd connectome
npm install
```

### Run a sample server and client:

```
cd samples/simple
```

Run server in first terminal tab:
```
node server.js
```

Run client in another terminal tab:
```
node client.js
```

Requires node.js with ES6 modules support, for example v13.8 and upwards.

## Production use

API is not yet stable, please wait until v1.0 release.

## Documentation

Soon.

## Showcases

Example **web/dapp** using **Connectome Alpha** is https://zetaseek.com.
