You might want to join this [telegram channel](https://t.me/joinchat/D_snZRsPkt8ttomJrINmqA) through which we will learn about the really basic Distributed Systems Theory and through which you can monitor the progress on Connectome 2.0 which is set to be released on 1.1.2021.

## The Purpose of this LIB

#### (As of v1.0)

This small and lean JavaScript library enables:

**Encrypted dynamic connections between each two endpoints.**

It works transparently between:

- two node.js processes
- between in-browser JavaScript and a node.js process

## But why? ü§∑

This approach facilitates hybrid dapps.

### Hybrid dapps?

These are distributed apps operating at the intersection of

- ‚Äî realtime (for immediacy and low latency of information propagation)
- ‚Äî byzantine fault tolerant consensus (for robust storage of <i>digital value</i> and digital data)

Such dapps are great because they combine and emphasize various aspects of desirable <i>fast</i> and <i>fair</i> human-to-computer-to-society interactions.

## v1.0 Features

- send and receive json messages
- RPC calls on javascript objects
- send and receive files

All messages and file chunks are encrypted.

## How to try if you are a JS developer

Get the library on your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/uniqpath/connectome.git
cd connectome
npm install
```

### Run a sample server and client:

```
cd samples/simple
```

Run server in first terminal tab:
```
node server.js
```

Run client in another terminal tab:
```
node client.js
```

Requires node.js with ES6 modules support, for example v13.8 and upwards.

## Production use

It is ready for production use. v2.0 even more so actually.

## API docs

Soon‚Ñ¢

## v2.0

Imminent release 1.1.2021 at 0:00 CET (we do a fun release each year starting from 2020).

<img src="https://github.com/uniqpath/info/blob/master/assets/img/fireworks.jpg?raw=true">

v2.0 is going to be well documented and broadly useful for niche hybrid dapps.

It will work in concert with other great JavaScript libraries that you might want to include in your frontend (and sometimes backend) projects.

## Showcases

1)

Example **web/dapp** using `Connectome 1.0` is https://zetaseek.com.

**ZetaSeek** is a Modular Decentralized Search Engine in Development.

2)

Another use case is **DMT-SERVER** which functions as a *Layer 1* for the thin ZetaSeek GUI layer.

DMT-SERVER will serve more web/dapps in near future apart from the Search Engine and not-well-known IoT / Decentralized Media Player prototypes that it powers today.

## dmt-system move to v2.0

<b>DMT‚óàPLAYER</b>, IoT and more 3rd party use cases will be mentioned here separately once they reach 2.0 milestone.

2.0 in general means more fruitful integrations with multiple promising emerging technologies as well as radical core design simplifications and general improvements (performance, usability, visuals).

Hope these help brighten some strange, sometimes even dark times (only if you let them seem so).
