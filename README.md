## ⚡ Dynamic realtime state and connectivity

→ for client and server-side javascript (soon WASM)

## Telegram group

You might want to join this [telegram channel](https://t.me/joinchat/D_snZRsPkt8ttomJrINmqA) through which we will learn about the really basic Distributed Systems Theory and through which you can monitor the progress on Connectome 1.0 which is set to be released on 1.1.2021.

## 10 week build-up theory course

[Connectome weekly articles](https://david.zetaseek.com/blog)

## The Purpose of this LIB

This small and lean JavaScript library enables many things. Stay tuned for documentation.

It enables many things but only *does a few things*. It does them close to perfection. Maybe even perfectly in some chosen sense that itself makes sense.

It only does **realtime connectivity** and **realtime state synchronization between two remote processes**.

It works transparently between:

- two node.js processes
- between in-browser JavaScript and a node.js process

All messages and file transfers are encrypted.

## How to try if you are a JS developer

Get the library on your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/uniqpath/connectome.git
cd connectome
npm install
```

### Run a sample server and client:

```
cd examples/node-to-node/simple
```

Run server in first terminal tab:
```
node server.js
```

Run client in another terminal tab:
```
node client.js
```

Requires node.js with ES6 modules support, for example v13.8 and upwards.

## Production use

API is not yet stable, please wait until v1.0 release.

## Documentation

Soon.

## Showcases

Example **web/dapp** using **Connectome Alpha** is https://zetaseek.com.

**ZetaSeek** is a Modular Decentralized Search Engine in Development.

## Connectome heavy usage in 2021

It will be used for building apps in `dmt` appstore for realtime web applications.
